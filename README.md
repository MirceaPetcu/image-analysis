# Requirements:
- opencv_python==4.8.1
- numpy==1.24.3

# Running Instructions:
All tasks are executed simultaneously in the Jupyter notebook file `all_tasks.ipynb`. All cells should be run from top to bottom. You need to change the path to the input files (the variable 'path' on line 4 in the input reading cell, marked accordingly with a markdown before it), and the variable 'test' in the same cell should be left (or set if it is not already) to True. The actual time for running the tasks in the run cell (marked accordingly with a markdown before it) is approximately 1 minute. The program will create text files in the current directory with the solutions for each round of each game (e.g., round 1 of game 1 will be in the file `1_01.txt`). In the created text files, there will be solutions for each task in the format found in the 'training' directory.
